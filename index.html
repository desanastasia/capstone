                <h2><strong>Unveiling Resilience: My Journey Through Childhood Trauma</strong></h2>
                    <div class="container">
                    <div class="text">
                <p>Hey There, My Name is Ana. I’m an Indigenous Woman from the Beautiful Cowichan Valley, Cowichan (Qu’wu’stun) Tribes. At 27, I’m still navigating the winding roads of life, exploring different paths, and discovering where my passions lie. I have two amazing children who inspire me every day to be the best version of myself. Jaxon my firstborn who is the life of the party at 5 and my baby girl Raelynn who’s one is basically my mini-me.</p>
                <p> Unfortunately, like many I think in indigenous communities I deal with a lot of intergenerational trauma and mental health issues. Untreated mental health issues and addiction runs deeply in my family.  My Mother was very young when she had me, she had just barely turned 16 when I was born. Then my sister about 1.5 years later. I don’t remember much of my early years but my mom has told me of the domestic violence she dealt with by my biological father. Growing up he wasn’t around very consistently. I don’t have any recollection of spending any quality time with him. My mom met my stepdad when I was still quite young, around 4 I believe. That’s when I felt like the disconnect really came between me and my mother. I and my sister started spending a lot more time with My grandma and aunties. my mom and stepdad traveled and just went out and did their own thing for some time before they had my youngest sister and brother. A lot of my childhood from here on out is quite blurry. My parents’ addictions to alcohol and gambling really took over our lives. Being the oldest I feel I took on a lot of unfairly placed responsibilities.</p>

                    </div>
                <p> After many years of this until I was 12 I moved in with my auntie, my mother’s younger sister. She was there a lot as well when I was young helping my grandma take care of me and my siblings. My teenage years were very difficult as well, losing my grandmother who was my only mother figure in life, witnessing a tragic car accident and almost losing my own life not only from being so close to the accident but also from the guilt of surviving. I silently dealt with my inner demons for most of my teenage years. I dropped out of high school. I self-isolated and honestly just rotted away in my room for years playing video games and watching anime I think just using anything to distract myself from my own thoughts.</p>

                        <div class="texts">
                <p>I met my current Partner and Father to my Children when I was a teenager. He is the nephew of my aunties friend. We shared a common interest in video games and the friendship that led to a relationship grew from there. He has no idea but he probably saved me. He was the first in a long time to show any genuine care for me, he was always a great listener and he just encouraged me to get out of the house and live. There are a lot of in-betweens from there and now but a couple of big things are that I’ve come to understand that what I dealt with was trauma and I am actively learning to cope with it. My childhood has inspired me to take on more “gentle parenting” beliefs. I strive to in any way I can help myself, my siblings/cousins, and anyone that will listen to break these cycles and heal.
                While my journey through life has been filled with its share of hardships, it has also been a testament to resilience, growth, and the power of healing. By sharing my story I hope to shed light on the complexities of childhood and intergenerational trauma and offer solace to those who may be navigating similar paths. Remember healing is not linear. It’s okay to seek support and be vulnerable. Together let’s break the silence, foster understanding, and work towards a community filled with empathy and compassion</p>

                <h2>Breaking the Cycle: Understanding Intergenerational Trauma from Residential Schools and My Personal Journey</h2>
                <h3><strong> What is Intergenerational Trauma?</strong></h3>
                    <p>Intergenerational trauma refers to the passing down of traumatic experiences and their psychological effects across generations and whole communities. These circumstances are very common in indigenous communities, where injustices like residential school systems have left a lasting impact on individuals and their descendants. The residential school system forced thousands of indigenous children from their homes to places often far away from their communities and many never returned. These school were most often overcrowded and underfunded, Thousands were physically and sexually assaulted, neglected. they were harshly punished for using their own language and culture. Staff were never held accountable, and these injustices have created a challenging path for these children and future generations to heal and simply lead normal healthy lives.</p>
                <h3><strong>How does is still affect current generations?</strong></h3>
                    <p>For many indigenous people, intergenerational trauma is not just a concept but a lived reality. despite not directly experiencing residential schools, the effects of this trauma continues to be passed down.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Racism</li>
                            <li> systematic discrimination</li>
                            <li>substance abuse</li>
                            <li>mental illness</li>
                            <li>loss of culture</li>
                            <li>cycle of violence and abuse</li>
                            <li> ongoing challenges in child welfare systems</li>
                            </div> 
                        </ul>
                    <p> This creates a cycle of trauma, pain, and suffering that continues to persist through generations today.</p>
                    <p>The effects of intergenerational trauma are severe and have many sides. Indigenous people often face increased risks of psychological distress, including anxiety, depression and substance abuse. Often unhealthy family dynamics manifest from this trauma. Families often have with difficulties in forming healthy attachments, experience neglect, and encountering violence. Additionally, untreated mental illness, loss of cultural connection further exacerbates the challenges.</p>
                <h3><strong>How intergenerational trauma personally affects me.</strong></h3>
                        <div class="container">
                            <div class="text">
                      
                   
                                <p>my grandmother and all of her siblings attended residential school, so I understand the toll it takes on individuals and families as a whole. I myself have dealt with little to no healthy familial connection, neglect and experienced violence in many forms. However, I am committed to breaking the cycle and working towards resilience within my family and band. I am dedicated to pursuing a career that will directly help my community. I want to advocate for awareness about intergenerational trauma because I feel it’s a significant piece to our journey building a thriving and successful community.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion addressing intergenerational trauma requires a multifaceted approach that acknowledges the historical and ongoing injustices faced by indigenous people. It involves providing culturally sensitive support, investing in community-led healing initiatives and challenging the systematic inequalities. By nurturing resilience, re-establishing cultural bonds, and aiding individuals and families in their healing process, we can initiate the process of breaking the cycle of intergenerational trauma and forging a more promising future for Indigenous communities.</p>
